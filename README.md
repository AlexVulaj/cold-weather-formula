### Description

In the winter months, the societal norms surrounding drinking are different.

_You know this._

You know how when you drink in December you feel like it shouldn't really count as much because it's cold out?

Same.

### Process

To help you calculate your adjusted winter drinking total, I've created this short script. How does it work? It's easy.

First, the program will prompt you for the current temperature outside in Fahrenheit.

Next, it will ask you how many drinks you've had.

Then this script will apply Max's Drinking in the Winter Formula :tm: to calculate your Adjusted Winter Drink Total.
